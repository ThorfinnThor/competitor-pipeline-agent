Our automated monitoring systems, covering clinical trial registries, regulatory filings (SEC), and corporate press releases, did not detect any significant new pipeline assets, major phase advancements, strategic deals, or unexpected discontinuations within the reporting period. While our internal CT.gov monitoring for J&J's own assets remains active, external competitive signals were minimal. We maintain vigilance on high-priority areas and specific competitor programs.",
