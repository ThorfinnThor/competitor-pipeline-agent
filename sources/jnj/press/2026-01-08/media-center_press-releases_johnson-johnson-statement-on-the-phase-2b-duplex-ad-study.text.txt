 Spring House, PA, December 26, 2025 – The Phase 2b DUPLEX-AD proof-of-concept study (95475939ADM2001) evaluated JNJ-95475939 (JNJ-5939) for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). The results of a planned interim analysis met prespecified criteria for early termination of the study, as they did not meet the high-bar efficacy we established for advancing our clinical development programs for atopic dermatitis. JNJ-5939 was well tolerated in the study.

 Johnson & Johnson is deeply committed to progressing our rich pipeline of clinical-stage and pre-clinical drug candidates for atopic dermatitis. As a chronic and often debilitating disease, where unmet need remains high, atopic dermatitis places both physical and emotional burdens on patients and their families. We look forward to delivering new, transformative medicines that have the greatest potential to meet the needs of the more than 100 million individuals worldwide impacted by this disease.

 Cautions Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
This statement contains “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 related to our atopic dermatitis pipeline. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations of future events. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of Johnson & Johnson. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: challenges and uncertainties inherent in product research and development, including the uncertainty of clinical success and of obtaining regulatory approvals; uncertainty of commercial success; manufacturing difficulties and delays; competition, including technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges to patents; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or regulatory action; changes in behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services; changes to applicable laws and regulations, including global health care reforms; and trends toward health care cost containment. A further list and descriptions of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in Johnson & Johnson’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in the sections captioned “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and in Johnson & Johnson’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of these filings are available online at www.sec.gov, www.jnj.com, www.investor.jnj.com or on request from Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information or future events or developments.
