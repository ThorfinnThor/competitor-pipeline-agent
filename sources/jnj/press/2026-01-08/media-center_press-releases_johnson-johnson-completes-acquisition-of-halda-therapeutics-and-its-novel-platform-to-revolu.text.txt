 NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ (December 29, 2025) – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the “Company”) today announced the successful completion of its acquisition of Halda Therapeutics OpCo, Inc. (“Halda”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a proprietary Regulated Induced Proximity TArgeting Chimera (RIPTAC™) platform to develop oral, targeted therapies for multiple types of solid tumors, including prostate cancer, for $3.05 billion in cash.

 “This strategic milestone underscores our commitment to redefining cancer treatment with breakthrough science and transformative medicines,” said Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson. “We are excited to formally welcome the talented Halda team to Johnson & Johnson and look forward to working together to achieve our shared goal of eliminating cancer.”

 With this acquisition, Johnson & Johnson adds HLD-0915, a clinical-stage therapy for prostate cancer, building on the Company’s nearly two decades of innovation in this disease area. HLD-0915 is a once-daily oral therapy that uses a novel RIPTAC™ platform with a precision cancer cell-killing approach that can overcome mechanisms of resistance to treatment. Additionally, the Company adds several earlier candidates for breast, lung and multiple other tumor types, based on RIPTAC™ technology, to its leading oncology portfolio. The novel technology may also enable the creation of transformative targeted therapies beyond oncology.

 “Johnson & Johnson continuously seeks new ways to meet patient needs and deliver innovative therapies,” said John C. Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine, R&D, Johnson & Johnson. “Now that we have finalized this acquisition, we will focus on advancing the potential of this promising pipeline of novel product candidates and harnessing the powerful RIPTAC™ platform to discover more molecules in oncology and beyond.”

 The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination. With the transaction now closing in 2025, Johnson & Johnson expects dilution in Q4 2025 and 2026 earnings. The total dilution to Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of approximately $0.20 is expected to split equally between 2025 and 2026 based on the latest estimates for the non-recurring charge related to Halda employee equity awards, financing and integration costs. Johnson & Johnson will provide commentary on full year 2026 guidance during the fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday, January 21, 2026.

 Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements :
This press release contains “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 related to the acquisition of Halda. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding future events, and are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of Johnson & Johnson’s control. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results and financial condition could vary materially from the expectations and projections Johnson & Johnson expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the satisfaction of closing conditions for the acquisition; the possibility that the transaction will not be completed in the expected timeframe or at all; the potential that the expected benefits and opportunities of the acquisition, if completed, may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; challenges inherent in product research and development, including uncertainty of clinical success and obtaining regulatory approvals; uncertainty of commercial success for new products; economic conditions, including currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations; competition, including technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges to patents; changes to applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws and global health care reforms; adverse litigation or government action; changes in behavior and spending patterns or financial distress of purchasers of health care products and services; and trends toward health care cost containment. In addition, if and when the transaction is consummated, there will be risks and uncertainties related to the ability of the Johnson & Johnson family of companies to successfully integrate Halda as well as the ability to ensure successful development and regulatory approval of Halda’s programs. A further list and descriptions of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in Johnson & Johnson’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in the sections captioned “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and in Johnson & Johnson’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of these filings are available online at www.sec.gov, www.jnj.com , www.investor.jnj.com or on request from Johnson & Johnson.
