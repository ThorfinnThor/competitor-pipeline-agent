 Irvine, CA – December 19, 2025 – Johnson & Johnson MedTech, a global leader in cardiac arrhythmia treatment, today announced its sponsorship of a new data collection platform developed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) to capture real-world data on pulsed field ablation (PFA) procedures used to treat atrial fibrillation (AFib). The first-of-its-kind registry will serve as a long-term data collection platform to evaluate clinical outcomes, support evidence-based practice, and inform the evolution of treatment strategies in electrophysiology.

 “We’re sponsoring this registry to enable real-world data generation at scale across the industry to shape the future of AFib ablation. By complementing our own evidence-generation registries and studies with this data platform, we aim to shape best practices, guide continued innovation and ultimately improve outcomes for more people living with AFib,” said Michael Bodner, Company Group Chair, Electrophysiology & Neurovascular, Johnson & Johnson MedTech. “This effort reflects our long-standing commitment to partnering with the clinical community and strengthening scientific understanding, a dedication grounded in our decades of scientific expertise and leadership in electrophysiology.”

 Johnson & Johnson MedTech is committed to advancing the science of PFA and driving progress in arrythmia care, building on our leadership and an unwavering dedication to enhance healthcare through rigorous scientific inquiry and clinical excellence in electrophysiology. This commitment is reflected in our comprehensive, fully integrated portfolio of imaging, mapping, and ablation technologies -including versatile PFA platforms- designed to deliver safe, precise, and consistent outcomes to support procedures across a wide range of patient needs.
